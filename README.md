# -Sign-Language-Recognition-

### Project Description 

**Situation**:
Millions of individuals with hearing and speech impairments rely on sign language as their primary form of communication. However, real-time interpretation tools are limited, often inaccessible, or unable to provide fast, accurate results in practical scenarios, especially for finger-spelled ASL alphabets.

**Task**:
To build a **vision-based real-time sign language recognition system** capable of accurately detecting static ASL finger-spelling gestures (excluding motion-based letters like J and Z) and converting them into readable text, enabling smoother human-computer and human-human interaction.

**Action**:

* Used the **"Sign Language Gesture Images Dataset"** from Kaggle with 37,500 images across 25 classes, including a custom “nothing” class for non-gesture frames.
* Preprocessing pipeline included **segmentation** (frame-by-frame hand isolation) and **binarization** to enhance image clarity against complex backgrounds.
* Developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**, optimized with pooling, ReLU activation, and fully connected layers for classification.
* Employed **OpenCV** for real-time image capture and processing, and **NumPy** for high-performance matrix operations.
* Tracked training and validation metrics over epochs to ensure overfitting avoidance and model generalization.

**Result**:

* Achieved **98.83% classification accuracy**, demonstrating high reliability for real-time use cases.
* The system is lightweight and responsive, designed to run efficiently on standard hardware using Python.
* Output results are displayed in real-time with accurate mapping of hand signs to ASL letters, offering practical application in communication tools for the deaf community.

**Additional Impact & Future Scope**:

* The system can be extended to recognize **dynamic gestures** (like J and Z) by incorporating temporal modeling (e.g., LSTM, 3D CNN).
* Potential integration into **assistive devices, AR/VR systems, educational apps**, or **public service kiosks**.
* With improved camera setups and temporal detection, it can evolve into a **full-fledged ASL sentence interpreter** including facial and body expressions.

**Key Features & Technical Highlights**:

The system incorporates a modular architecture, beginning with human-hand detection, followed by gesture classification and interpretation, ensuring real-time responsiveness and scalability.

It uses a vision-based approach over glove-based alternatives, making it more cost-effective and user-friendly, without requiring specialized hardware.

The CNN model benefits from a well-defined feature extraction pipeline that focuses on the shape, position, and orientation of hand gestures—factors crucial for high-accuracy recognition.

The project demonstrates effective use of open-source tools (TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy), making the solution reproducible and extendable for future research or deployment in embedded systems.

It offers a practical implementation of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for accessibility, with potential to enhance communication in healthcare, education, and customer service for differently-abled individuals.
